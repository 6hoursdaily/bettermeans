= Dev notes

We are working on using bundler to wrap up the dev environment. 
To learn more about it check it out here: http://gembundler.com/

Our tests are broken. Help us write great tests and catch up on our testing environment!

== Dev database

The bettermeans projects is renamed to "LOCAL BETTERMEANS" to avoid confusion with the production dashboards.
All passwords in included dev db are set to: "password"
All private workstreams are removed.

All other the data in the dev database is real!
Please respect our user's privacy, and use the data in the db only for development purposes. (goes without saying I know)
----

= Getting started

git clone git@github.com:kabuks/bettermeans.git
Rename database.yml.example to database.yml
rake bootstrap

#for a larger data set on postgresql db, skip rake bootstrap and load from dump file. 
#This recommended since it mirrors our production env.
psql bettermeans_development < db/pgdump.sql

that's it. now you're ready to change the world!

= Known issues

Attachments doesn't work in dev environment
Logging in via the janrain plugin (e.g. google, twitter...etc) won't work in dev environment (if you need to work with this, drop me a message, there's an involved workaround)

= Creating a db from production

You shouldn't need to. But if you do....
To create a new dev db from production:

heroku db:pull # Load production database
export reset_safe=true
rake custom:trim_db
rake db:schema:dump 
rake db:seed:dump MODELS=tracker,issue_statuss,enumeration,role,plan,setting
# Uses https://github.com/rhalff/seed_dump

To generate a pg_dump:
pg_dump bettermeans_development -c -O -x -f db/pgdump.sql
